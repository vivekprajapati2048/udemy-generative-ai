If you are on Enterprise plan and have questions about cost optimization,\\nplease reach out to your sales rep or support@langchain.dev.\\nThis tutorial walks through optimizing your spend on LangSmith. In it, we will learn how to optimize existing spend\\nand prevent future overspend on a realistic real-world example. We will use an existing LangSmith organization with high usage.\\nConcepts can be transferred to your own organization.\\nProblem Setup\\u200b\\nIn this tutorial, we take an existing organization that has three workspaces, one for each deployment stage\\n(Dev, Staging, and Prod):\\n\\nUnderstand your current usage\\u200b\\nThe first step of any optimization process is to understand current usage. LangSmith gives two ways to do this: Usage Graph\\nand Invoices.\\nUsage Graph\\u200b\\nThe usage graph lets us examine how much of each usage based pricing metric we have consumed lately. It does not directly show\\nspend (which we will see later on our draft invoice).\\nWe can navigate to the Usage Graph under Settings -> Usage and Billing -> Usage Graph.\\n\\nWe see in the graph above that there are two usage metrics that LangSmith charges for:\\n\\nLangSmith Traces (Base Charge)\\nLangSmith Traces (Extended Data Retention Upgrades).\\n\\nThe first metric tracks all traces that you send to LangSmith. The second tracks all traces that also have our Extended 400 Day Data Retention.\\nFor more details, see our data retention conceptual docs. Notice that these graphs look\\nidentical, which will come into play later in the tutorial.\\nLangSmith Traces usage is measured per workspace, because workspaces often represent development environments (as in our example),\\nor teams within an organization. As a LangSmith administrator, we want to understand spend granularly per each of these units. In\\nthis case where we just want to cut spend, we can focus on the environment responsible for the majority of costs first for the greatest savings.\\nnoteLangSmith\\'s Usage Graph and Invoice use the term tenant_id to refer to a workspace ID. They are interchangeable.\\nIn the above image, the vast majority of usage is in the workspace with ID c27dd32c-7c80-4e8c-acde-bfcb67a90ab2. We can\\ngo to Settings -> Workspaces, and hover our mouse over the Workspace ID button to find the one with a matching ID. In\\nthis case, it\\'s the Prod workspace:\\n\\nInvoices\\u200b\\nWe understand what usage looks like in terms of traces, but we now need to translate that into spend. To do so,\\nwe head to the Invoices tab. The first invoice that will appear on screen is a draft of your current month\\'s\\ninvoice, which shows your running spend thus far this month.\\n\\nIn the above GIF, we see that the charges for LangSmith Traces are broken up by \"tenant_id\" (i.e. Workspace ID), meaning we can track tracing spend\\non each of our workspaces. In the first few days of June, the vast majority of the total spend of ~$2,000 is in our production\\nworkspace. Further, the majority of spend in that workspace was on extended data retention trace upgrades.\\nThese upgrades occur for two reasons:\\n\\nYou use extended data retention tracing, meaning that, by default, your traces are retained for 400 days\\nYou use base data retention tracing, and use a feature that automatically extends the data retention of a trace (see our Auto-Upgrade conceptual docs)\\n\\nGiven that the number of total traces per day is equal to the number of extended retention traces per day, it\\'s most likely the\\ncase that this org is using extended data retention tracing everywhere. As such, we start by optimizing our retention settings.\\nOptimization 1: manage data retention\\u200b\\nLangSmith charges differently based on a trace\\'s data retention (see our data retention conceptual docs),\\nwhere short-lived traces are an order of magnitude less expensive than ones that last for a long time. In this optimization, we will\\nshow how to get optimal settings for data retention without sacrificing historical observability, and\\nshow the effect it has on our bill.\\nChange org level retention defaults for new projects\\u200b\\nWe navigate to the Usage configuration tab, and look at our organization level retention settings. Modifying this setting affects all new projects that are\\ncreated going forward in all workspaces in our org.\\nnoteFor backwards compatibility, older organizations may have this defaulted to Extended. Organizations created after June 3rd\\nhave this defaulted to Base.\\n\\nChange project level retention defaults\\u200b\\nOur existing projects have not changed their data retention settings, so we can change these on the individual project pages.\\nWe navigate to Projects -> <your project name>, click the data retention drop down, and modify it to base retention. As\\nwith the organization level setting, this will only affect retention (and pricing) for traces going forward.\\n\\nKeep around a percentage of traces for extended data retention\\u200b\\nWe may not want all our traces to expire after 14 days if we care about historical debugging. As such, we can take advantage\\nof LangSmith\\'s built in ability to do server side sampling for extended data retention.\\nChoosing the right percentage of runs to sample depends on your use case. We will arbitrarily pick 10% of runs here, but will\\nleave it to the user to find the right value that balances collecting rare events and cost constraints.\\nLangSmith automatically upgrades the data retention for any trace that matches a run rule in our automations product (see our run rules docs). On the\\nprojects page, click Rules -> Add Rule, and configure the rule as follows:\\n\\nRun rules match on runs rather than traces. Runs are single units of work within an LLM application\\'s API handling. Traces\\nare end to end API calls (learn more about tracing concepts in LangSmith). This means a trace can\\nbe thought of as a tree of runs making up an API call. When a run rule matches any run within a trace, the trace\\'s full run tree\\nupgrades to be retained for 400 days.\\nTherefore, to make sure we have the proper sampling rate on traces, we take advantage of the\\nfiltering functionality of run rules.\\nWe add add a filter condition to only match the \"root\" run in the run tree. This is distinct per trace, so our 10% sampling\\nwill upgrade 10% of traces, rather 10% of runs, which could correspond to more than 10% of traces. If desired, we can optionally add\\nany other filtering conditions required (e.g. specific tags/metadata attached to our traces) for more pointed data retention\\nextension. For the sake of this tutorial, we will stick with the simplest condition, and leave more advanced filtering as an\\nexercise to the user.\\nnoteIf you want to keep a subset of traces for longer than 400 days for data collection purposes, you can create another run\\nrule that sends some runs to a dataset of your choosing. A dataset allows you to store the trace inputs and outputs (e.g., as a key-value dataset),\\nand will persist indefinitely, even after the trace gets deleted.\\nSee results after 7 days\\u200b\\nWhile the total amount of traces per day stayed the same, the extended data retention traces was cut heavily.\\n\\nThis translates to the invoice, where we\\'ve only spent about $900 in the last 7 days, as opposed to $2,000 in the previous 4.\\nThat\\'s a cost reduction of nearly 75% per day!\\n\\nOptimization 2: limit usage\\u200b\\nIn the previous section, we managed data retention settings to optimize existing spend. In this section, we will\\nuse usage limits to prevent future overspend.\\nLangSmith has two usage limits: total traces and extended retention traces. These correspond to the two metrics we\\'ve\\nbeen tracking on our usage graph. We can use these in tandem to have granular control over spend.\\nTo set limits, we navigate back to Settings -> Usage and Billing -> Usage configuration. There is a table at the\\nbottom of the page that lets you set usage limits per workspace. For each workspace, the two limits appear, along\\nwith a cost estimate:\\n\\nLets start by setting limits on our production usage, since that is where the majority of spend comes from.\\nSetting a good total traces limit\\u200b\\nPicking the right \"total traces\" limit depends on the expected load of traces that you will send to LangSmith. You should\\nclearly think about your assumptions before setting a limit.\\nFor example:\\n\\nCurrent Load: Our gen AI application is called between 1.2-1.5 times per second, and each API request has a trace associated with it,\\nmeaning we log around 100,000-130,000 traces per day\\nExpected Growth in Load: We expect to double in size in the near future.\\n\\nFrom these assumptions, we can do a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation to get a good limit of:\\nlimit = current_load_per_day * expected_growth * days/month      = 130,000 * 2 * 30      = 7,800,000 traces / month\\nWe click on the edit icon on the right side of the table for our Prod row, and can enter this limit as follows:\\n\\nnoteWhen set without the extended data retention traces limit, the maximum cost estimator assumes that all traces are using extended data retention.\\nCutting maximum spend with an extended data retention limit\\u200b\\nIf we are not a big enterprise, we may shudder at the ~$40k per month bill.\\nWe saw from Optimization 1 that the easiest way to cut cost was through managing data retention.\\nThe same can be said for limits. If we only want to keep ~10% of traces to be around more than 14 days, we can set a limit on the maximum\\nhigh retention traces we can keep. That would be .10 * 7,800,000 = 780,000.\\n\\nAs we can see, the maximum cost is cut from ~40k per month to ~7.5k per month, because we no longer allow as many expensive\\ndata retention upgrades. This lets us be confident that new users on the platform will not accidentally cause cost to balloon.\\nnoteThe extended data retention limit can cause features other than traces to stop working once reached. If you plan to\\nuse this feature, please read more about its functionality here.\\nSet dev/staging limits and view total spent limit across workspaces\\u200b\\nFollowing the same logic for our dev and staging environments, we set limits at 10% of the production\\nlimit on usage for each workspace.\\nWhile this works with our usage pattern, setting good dev and staging limits may vary depending on\\nyour use case with LangSmith. For example, if you run evals as part of CI/CD in dev or staging, you may\\nwant to be more liberal with your usage limits to avoid test failures.\\nNow that our limits are set, we can see that LangSmith shows a maximum spend estimate across all workspaces:\\n\\nWith this estimator, we can be confident that we will not end up with an unexpected credit card bill at the end of the month.\\nSummary\\u200b\\nIn this tutorial, we learned how to:\\n\\nCut down our existing costs with data retention policies\\nPrevent future overspend with usage limits\\n\\nIf you have questions about further optimizing your spend, please reach out to support@langchain.dev.Was this page helpful?You can leave detailed feedback on GitHub.PreviousTutorialsNextAdministration how-to guidesProblem SetupUnderstand your current usageUsage GraphInvoicesOptimization 1: manage data retentionChange org level retention defaults for new projectsChange project level retention defaultsKeep around a percentage of traces for extended data retentionSee results after 7 daysOptimization 2: limit usageSetting a good total traces limitCutting maximum spend with an extended data retention limitSet dev/staging limits and view total spent limit across workspacesSummaryCommunityTwitterGitHubDocs CodeLangSmith SDKPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogLangChain Python DocsLangChain JS/TS DocsCopyright © 2025 LangChain, Inc.\\n\\n')]"
