The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area.

While various reconstruction a nd rehabilitation \\nactivities were in progress, during the discussions with the members  of tribal council, I \\nrealized the unique trait among the Car-Nicobar islanders. Even thoug h there were many \\nhuman losses due to the Tsunami of 26 Dec 2004, the tribal islanders had  taken \\npossession of affected victims as their children and there is nothi ng like orphanage in \\nCar-Nicobar Islands. Touched by their courage, I composed few vers es called “Sea \\nWaves” which reads as follows: \\nSea Waves \\n \\nWe are the children of Sea waves, \\nSea waves are my friends. \\nWhen they become angry, \\nSea waves give the challenges. \\nGod has given the courage, \\nTo challenge the sea waves. \\nAnd we will succeed, \\nWe will succeed \\nWith Almighty’s grace. \\nAll the members who were gathered in the village sang the poem  with me and exhibited \\nlots of courage and enthusiasm even though they had gone through severe  suffering \\nduring the Tsunami. \\n \\nConnectivity for societal transformation \\nI addressed the Pan African Parliament on 16 September 2004, at Johanne sburg, South \\nAfrica. This was attended by 53 member countries of the Africa n Union, where I \\nproposed the concept of Pan African e-Network for providing seamless and integrated \\nsatellite, fiber optics and wireless network connecting 53 African countries at an \\nestimated cost of US $ 100 million. \\n \\nAs part of the project 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Afri ca), 17 Super \\nSpecialty Hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa), 53 tele-me dicine centers and 53 \\ntele-education centres in Africa will be connected. The pilot project on tele-education and \\ntele-medicine in Ethiopia has already been commissioned.

In these three experiences, I personal ly felt proud of our \\never vigilant Soldiers, Sailors and Air Warriors performing their  tasks beyond the call of \\ntheir duty even in the most adverse circumstances natural and man m ade. During the last \\nfive years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regime nts, participate in \\nnumber of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake  peace \\nmissions and interact with the family members of our Defence F orces. Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat. The \\nNation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defenc e Forces. \\nSimilarly, I had opportunities to interact \\nwith members of our para-military forces, central and state poli ce personnel including \\ninternal security forces who are making immense contribution in au gmenting the safety \\nand security of our citizens under difficult conditions. \\n \\nYouth movement for Developed India 2020 \\nRecently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting i nto practice the motto \\nof transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen.

As per the district authorities the impact of the  training on the students is \\nvisible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and tea chers shedding of stage \\nfear and recognition of their duties towards the nation. I talke d to Ms. Padma, a student \\nleader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda who relat ed how she \\nweaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of  the 10 point oath from \\nthe Lead India Training Camp. This gives me an assurance that the  youth of our country \\nare on the right path \\nthrough this mission oriented programme. With the ignited minds of the  540 million \\nyouth below the age of 25, which I consider is the most powerful resour ce on the earth, \\nunder the earth and above the earth, we have to empower the youth through va lue based \\neducation and leadership. \\n \\nConclusion \\nI was touched by the variety of Indian panorama, emotional content of  the tune, cultural \\ndiversity and unity of minds in the vast land of ours.

However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity.

Our country is blessed with natural resources, has shown c onsiderable \\nprogress in the last sixty years, and above all we have hard wor king people particularly \\nthe power of the 540 million youth of the country. Every sector of our count ry has given \\nme the \\nconfidence that India can become a developed nation well before 2020. Whomsoeve r, I \\nmet they constantly ask what they can give to the nation. We should c onstantly strive to \\nempower such members of the society. With this spirit, I am extr emely happy that we are \\non the right path. Here I am reminded of a famous poem: \\n\"When you wish upon a star, \\nMakes no difference who you are, \\nAnything your heart desires, \\nWill come to you” \\nThis poem is true to all of us, and particularly for our youth and i f they aim great, I am \\nsure they will reach close to the target or the target. \\n \\nMy dear citizens, let us resolve to continue to work for realizing the missions of \\ndeveloped India 2020 with the following distinctive profile. \\n \\n1. A Nation where the rural and urban divide has reduced to a thin line. \\n \\n2. A Nation where there is an equitable distribution and adequate acce ss to energy and \\nquality water. \\n \\n3. A Nation where agriculture, industry and service sector work together in symphony. \\n \\n4. A Nation where education with value system is not denied to any meritorious \\ncandidates because of societal or economic discrimination. \\n \\n5. A Nation which is the best destination for the most talented s cholars, scientists, and \\ninvestors.'),\n",

He reflects on his five years in office, enriched by interactions with people from various walks of life. He shares 10 important messages that he learned during his tenure, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accelerating development, which was inspired by a young girl's question about India becoming a developed nation by 2020.\n",
      "2. Empowering villages and mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness.\n",
      "3. Fostering agricultural growth through \"Seed to Food\".\n",
      "4. Overcoming problems through partnership and courage.\n",
      "5. Building connectivity for societal transformation.\n",
      "6. Defending the nation with pride.\n",
      "7. And promoting a youth movement for a developed India by 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "He expresses gratitude to everyone who has contributed to his time in office and looks forward to continuing his work for the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question and acknowledged it as thoughtful. They assured the person that their dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and that they would work towards making it a reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of empowering Indian villages and youth to achieve a prosperous and developed nation by 2020. The speaker shares their experience visiting a village in Nagaland, where they saw a thriving village council with financial powers and a prosperous community. The speaker suggests that empowering all 600,000 Indian villages to take charge of their development and connect with urban societies could lead to significant transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also highlights an initiative by Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, which aims to provide urban amenities to rural areas through a complex involving 65 villages. This initiative provides three types of connectivity (physical, electronic, and knowledge) to facilitate economic connectivity and has led to large-scale employment generation and entrepreneurship.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the success of the Periyar PURA (Participatory Urban-Rural Action) program in Thanjavur district, which has generated employment and created entrepreneurs with the support of 1000 self-help groups. The program has transformed 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land, where villagers are growing Jatropha, herbal, and medicinal plants, generating power using biomass, processing food, and running marketing centers. The program has also enabled the development of internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products with the help of Japanese experts. The program has enhanced the innovative ability of the people, enabling them to produce internationally acceptable products. The speaker believes that the country needs around 7000 PURA programs to bridge the rural-urban divide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two enriching experiences. The first is a visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan where they met over 6,000 farmers from different states and union territories. The farmers showed interest in the various gardens, including Mughal, Herbal, Spiritual, Musical, Bio-diesel, and Nutrition Gardens. The speaker highlights the need to double agricultural production with reduced land, water, and manpower, and to empower farmers to protect the land for a second green revolution. They express confidence that the nation can increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through the partnership of farmers, scientists, and industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second experience is a meeting with a wheelchair-bound individual, Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who has no hands or legs. Despite his disability, he is happy and confident, and expresses gratitude to God, his parents, teachers, and others for giving him the gift of confidence, training, and help. When asked what he could do for him, he replied that he would like to sing in front of others, indicating that he has found happiness and purpose despite his physical limitations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech describes two inspiring stories:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. A physically challenged individual, despite his limitations, has a latent talent for music. With positive attitude and perseverance, he has developed his skills and now wants to share his art to inspire others. He has even performed at the Rashtra pati Bhavan art theatre.\n",
      "2. The speech highlights the resilience of the people of Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, who were recovering from a devastating earthquake in 2005. Despite the severe damage to their school building and personal losses, the villagers showed courage and determination, defeating their problems rather than allowing them to become their master. The Army, Air Force, and state government played a crucial role in relief and rescue operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be a reflection on the author's experiences with courageous acts by citizens in the face of natural disasters and calamities. The author mentions two specific instances:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. In a village affected by an earthquake, the author saw children and villagers bravely participating in relief operations alongside the Armed Forces, with the Acting Chief Justice of Jammu & Kashmir and State Government authorities on-site to provide relief grants to affected families.\n",
      "2. In Car Nicobar Islands, following the 2004 Tsunami, the author met with Tribal Council Leaders, Students, and Children who had taken in affected victims as their own, showing remarkable courage and resilience. The author was inspired by their story and composed a poem called \"Sea Waves\" to commemorate their bravery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author concludes by highlighting the importance of connectivity and societal transformation, mentioning a speech they delivered to the Pan African Parliament in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2004.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech mentions the proposal of a Pan African e-Network, a project to connect 53 African countries with seamless and integrated satellite, fiber optics, and wireless networks at an estimated cost of $100 million. The project aims to connect 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Africa), 17 hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa), 53 tele-medicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers in Africa. A pilot project on tele-education and tele-medicine has already been commissioned in Ethiopia, where Indian specialists from CARE Hospital are providing medical services to local students.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the following topics:\n",
      "\n",
      "* India's contribution to Africa: The speaker mentions that Indian technology has been used to provide tele-consultation services to doctors in Ethiopia's Black Lion Hospital, and that the Pan African network will enable instant communication between Heads of State across 53 African countries.\n",
      "* Defending the nation: The speaker expresses pride in India's Defence Forces, highlighting their bravery, commitment, and devotion to duty. They mention personal experiences, including visiting the Indian Army's KUMAR post in Siachen Glacier, taking an underwater journey on INS Sindhurakshak, and flying a Sukhoi-30 fighter jet. The speaker notes that the Defence Forces are always vigilant, even in difficult circumstances, and that the nation cherishes their valour.\n",
      "* Youth movement for a Developed India 2020: The speaker mentions meeting a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are working to transform India's youth into enlightened citizens through the Lead India 2020 Foundation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is discussing the Lead India 2020 Foundation, a program that trains students in Andhra Pradesh to become enlightened citizens. The program has had a positive impact on the students, particularly in the Medak district, where they have shown improvement in self-discipline, love for their parents and teachers, and recognition of their duties towards the nation. The speaker shares a personal anecdote about a student leader who was inspired by the program to help her father stop smoking. The speaker believes that empowering youth through value-based education and leadership is crucial, as they are the most powerful resource on the earth. The speech concludes by highlighting the diversity and unity of India's culture and tradition, and the efforts being made by various agencies to promote these values.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural and civilizational heritage while pursuing economic growth. They express confidence in the country's progress over the past 60 years and the potential of its 540 million youth. The speaker encourages constant striving to empower members of society and quotes a poem about making one's dreams come true. They propose a resolution to work towards a developed India by 2020, with a profile that includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reduced urban-rural divide\n",
      "2. Equitable energy and water distribution\n",
      "3. Harmony between agriculture, industry, and services\n",
      "4. Equal access to education for all, regardless of societal or economic background\n",
      "5. India becoming a top destination for talented scholars, scientists, and investors\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech outlines a vision for a perfect society, where:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Healthcare is accessible to all\n",
      "* Governance is responsive, transparent, and corruption-free\n",
      "* Poverty, illiteracy, and crimes against women and children are eradicated\n",
      "* Everyone feels included and not alienated\n",
      "* The nation is prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy, with sustainable growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The President of India, Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, expresses gratitude to the citizens for their support and cooperation over the past five years. He mentions his mission to bring unity and confidence among the diverse population of India, and to make India a developed nation by 2020.

      "In his departing speech, former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam reflects on his five-year tenure at Rashtrapati Bhavan, highlighting key messages for accelerating development and empowering villages. He shares a personal anecdote about a young girl's question about India becoming a developed nation by 2020, emphasizing the importance of investing in the country's youth and working together to achieve this goal. Kalam also shares his experiences visiting villages, including a unique encounter with a tribal village council in Nagaland, where he saw the empowered village council functioning effectively. He emphasizes the need to provide physical connectivity through quality roads to enable faster movement of products from villages to markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam stresses the importance of empowering farmers to protect and nurture fertile land for a second green revolution, and expresses confidence that the nation can increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through partnerships between farmers, agricultural scientists, and industries. He also shares heartwarming stories about meeting individuals who have overcome challenges, including Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a person born without hands and legs, and the people of Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, who showed courage and resilience in the face of adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, Kalam highlights the significance of connectivity for societal transformation, citing his proposal for the Pan African e-Network, which aims to provide seamless and integrated satellite, fiber optics, and wireless network connecting 53 African countries at an estimated cost of US $100 million. The project has already made significant progress, with Hyderabad providing one-hour live tele-consultation to doctors in Black Lion Hospital, Addis Ababa in Cardiology and Radiology since November 2006, and connecting Heads of State in all 53 countries for instant communication. Kalam expresses pride in India's ability to bring technology to the people, enabling societal transformation in Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, Kalam defends the nation's defense forces, sharing his experiences visiting Siachen Glacier, INS Sindhurakshak, and flying in a Sukhoi-30 fighter. He highlights the bravery, commitment, and devotion to duty of the defense forces, who are always vigilant and ready to counter any threat. Kalam also acknowledges the important contributions of para-military forces, central and state police personnel, and internal security forces in ensuring the safety and security of citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, Kalam emphasizes the importance of a youth movement for a developed India 2020, citing his meeting with a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are working towards this goal. Overall, Kalam's departing speech emphasizes the importance of empowering villages, farmers, and individuals, as well as the need for partnership, resilience, and connectivity in overcoming challenges and achieving development, with a focus on connectivity as a key enabler of societal transformation.\n",
