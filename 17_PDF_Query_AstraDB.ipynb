No.: F1-23/2000-2E \\nISBN 0-662-28617-0speeche•good  2/27/00  11:08 AM  Page 2Introduction\\nMr. Speaker, before I begin, I want to express the Government’s\\nappreciation to the Standing Committee on Finance and the manycommittees of caucus for their invaluable contributions in the lead-up to this budget.\\nMost importantly, on behalf of this Parliament, I want to thank\\nCanadians – from all walks of life and all parts of the country –who shared their ideas and insights with us. \\nThe experience of the last few years has confirmed, beyond\\ndoubt, that an open budget process is a better budget process.\\nMr. Speaker, throughout our country’s history, each generation\\nhas undertaken the great task of building Canada.\\nToday, at the dawn of a new century, we are fortunate indeed\\nto live in a land of promise, in a world of change, in a time ofopportunity.\\nAre there problems? Yes there are – and there is much to\\nbe done.\\nThat being said, we are in a better position today to chart our\\nown course than we have been in many a decade.\\nEconomic Strength\\nCanada’s economic growth is among the strongest of the Group ofSeven (G-7) countries. \\nThe size of our economy will surpass the trillion-dollar mark\\nthis year.\\nThe deficit is a matter of history. Indeed, today we project the\\nthird, fourth and fifth balanced budgets in a row – something thathas not been done in nearly half a century. \\nInflation remains in check.The government debt burden is declining.Canada’s foreign debt burden is declining.Consumer and business confidence are at near-record levels.\\n3speeche•good  2/27/00  11:08 AM  Page 3Most importantly, after a number of difficult years, these\\npositive economic indicators are now beginning to be reflected in thedaily lives of Canadians.\\nIn 1999, there were more than 425,000 new jobs created in\\nCanada – a pace unmatched by any other G-7 country and, as aresult, our unemployment rate stands at 6.8 per cent – its lowestlevel in nearly a quarter of a century. \\nIn the early and mid-1990s, Canadians saw their real after-tax\\nincomes shrink. Three years ago, that trend began to turn around.Today, disposable incomes are some 3 per cent higher than theywere in 1996 and, of even greater moment, private sector forecastersproject that incomes will rise much more significantly in the yearsahead.\\nThis is clearly good news.However, Mr. Speaker, while the progress of recent years is a\\nrecord on which Canadians can be proud to stand, it is not a recordon which we are prepared to rest.  \\nCanadians do not want to dwell on the past. They want to focus\\non the future.\\nIndeed, that is the message of this budget.In 1993, we established a plan to eliminate the deficit, to turn\\nour economy around and create new jobs. That plan has worked.\\nNow – two months into the year 2000 – we must take Canada\\nfurther. We must create a greater prosperity and see to it that thebenefits of that prosperity are shared widely.\\nOur challenge now is to build on our new-found strength. Canadians know that this is the time to act. They know that\\nglobalization and the rush of technology will not wait for us, norwill these forces pause for us to prepare. The challenges are here andthe opportunities are now.BETTER FINANCES, BETTER LIVES\\n4speeche•good  2/27/00  11:08 AM  Page 4Building for the Future: Our Plan\\nIn last fall’s fiscal update, we asked ourselves three fundamental\\nquestions:\\nFirst, what will it take to secure our position as a leader in the\\nnew economy?\\nSecond, how can we provide every Canadian with an equal\\nopportunity to succeed?\\nAnd third, how can we ensure the best quality of life for all\\nCanadians, not simply a fortunate few?\\nIn this budget, we outline our response to those questions.First, we will continue to provide sound fiscal management.\\nThere will be no slipping, no sliding: the days of deficit are goneand they are not coming back.\\nSecond, we will lower taxes to promote economic growth and to\\nleave more money where it belongs – in the pockets of Canadians.As we said last November, Canadians are entitled to keep more ofthe money they earn. After all, they worked for it. It’s theirs.\\nThird, in order to ensure equality of opportunity, we will invest\\nin providing Canadians with the skills and knowledge they need toget the jobs they want. \\nAnd fourth, together we will build an economy based on\\ninnovation. For that, ultimately, is the only means by which amodern nation can control its future.\\nReflecting Our Values: Education and Health Care\\nMr. Speaker, these four elements speak to our economic framework.But our plan must do more than that.\\nIt must reflect not only the value of our economy, but the values\\nof our society.\\nMake no mistake – the success we have achieved as a nation\\nhas come not only from strong growth, but from an abidingcommitment to strong values – caring and compassion, aninsistence that there be an equitable sharing of the benefits ofeconomic growth.SPEECH\\n5speeche•good  2/27/00  11:08 AM  Page 5These are the bedrock of our nation. They must be the\\ncornerstone of our plan.\\nFor this reason, the first announcement of the first budget of\\nthe 21stcentury is that we will increase funding for post-secondary\\neducation and health care. \\nThese are the highest priorities of Canadians – and they\\nare ours.\\nWe have already acted three times to strengthen the cash\\ntransfers to the provinces through the Canada Health and SocialTransfer (CHST).\\nIndeed, last year, for health care alone, we made the single\\nlargest investment in this government’s history. \\nAt that time, we also said we would do more, as resources\\npermit. Today, we make good on that commitment. We areannouncing the transfer of a further $2.5 billion to the provinces touse over four years for post-secondary education and health care.\\nFurthermore, to meet pressing needs in our universities, colleges\\nand hospitals, the provinces will have the flexibility to draw uponthis new cash sooner – should they choose to do so.\\nAs a result of this and last year’s budgets, the cash component\\nof the CHST will rise from the 1998-1999 level of $12.5 billion to$15.5 billion next year – an increase of almost 25 per cent overjust two years.\\nTherefore, the total annual support provided through the\\nCHST – tax points and cash – will reach close to $31 billion nextyear – an all-time high.\\nWe have guaranteed the provinces stable and growing funding\\nfor health care and post-secondary education.\\nToday, that is what we are continuing to do. Nor is that the end of the story. Equalization payments to the provinces will be $500 million\\nhigher this year than projected in last year’s budget. \\nAs a result, Equalization transfers as well are now at an\\nall-time high.\\nThis means more money for less prosperous provinces for\\nhealth care, education and other programs.BETTER FINANCES, BETTER LIVES\\n6speeche•good  2/27/00  11:08 AM  Page 6Sound Financial Management\\nMr. Speaker, let me now turn to our plan for building a stronger\\neconomy. \\nPrior to the fall update, we consulted with a number of\\neconomists from Canada’s major chartered banks and four majorforecasting firms.\\nThis invited a national debate on our longer-term objectives –\\na debate based on a series of projections about the size of the budgetsurplus for each of the next five years.\\nThese projections were sound. But we also know, especially for\\nthe later years, that they are just that – projections. They are betson the future, not money in the bank.\\nTherefore, while we must always set longer-term objectives, we\\nwill continue to make decisions only on a rolling two-year basis. \\nWe will also continue to build additional prudence into our\\nplanning and to set aside a $3-billion Contingency Reserve toprotect against unforeseen events. \\nLet there be no doubt, this government will not repeat the\\nmistakes of others and spend money we might not have, or raiseexpectations we cannot meet. \\nNor will we abandon the balanced approach we have adopted\\nfrom the beginning – an approach which recognizes that debtreduction, tax relief and spending on health, post-secondaryeducation and other key priorities are not competing claims, butcomplementary components of a fair and effective plan.\\nLet me now turn to the debt. Canada has not just eliminated its deficit. We are one of the few\\ncountries that is now reducing the absolute amount of its debt, andwe will continue to do so.\\nIndeed, over the past two years, we have paid down the debt\\nby more than $6 billion, resulting in interest savings of more than$300 million a year, every year. \\nAs well, market debt – the debt issued in financial markets –\\nhas fallen even further. By the end of this fiscal year, we will havereduced it by close to $20 billion.SPEECH\\n7speeche•good  2/27/00  11:08 AM  Page 7Even more importantly, Canada’s debt-to-GDP (gross domestic\\nproduct) ratio, which measures the amount of debt against the sizeof our economy, has improved markedly. The lower the ratio, themore manageable the debt. \\nIn 1995, Canada’s debt ratio was 71 per cent. Today it has\\ndropped by 10 percentage points and should fall below 50 per centby the year 2004.  \\nBeyond this, the downward track must continue. We are still a\\nlong way from the 25-per-cent ratio Canada enjoyed in the late1960s – the last time our books were in the black.\\nMr. Speaker, economic growth has played an important role in\\nCanada’s falling debt ratio. So has controlling government spending.\\nWe have previously pointed out that federal government\\nspending, as a percentage of GDP, is at its lowest level in 50 years.\\nThe fact is that even after taking into account the measures to\\nbe outlined in this budget, program spending next year will be$4 billion lower than it was when we took office in 1993. \\nLet there be no doubt – we will control spending.For instance, beginning with the time we balanced the books\\nand looking ahead to the year 2001-2002, growth in programspending is projected to be in line with inflation plus populationgrowth – the standard used by most economic commentators. \\nHaving said that, the standard of living we enjoy does not\\ncome free. \\nFor instance, fully two-thirds of all the new spending measures\\nsince we eliminated the deficit have been in the areas of health care,post-secondary education and innovation. \\nFurthermore, there are other fields where the Government must\\ntake action, areas where we have fundamental responsibilities athome and essential obligations abroad.\\nThe crisis faced by farm families and communities across\\nthe country is real, and better short- and long-term solutionsare required. \\nThe RCMP faces new challenges in the area of organized crime\\nand international terrorism.\\nThe demands upon our military, whose men and women\\ncontribute so much at home and abroad, are increasing.BETTER FINANCES, BETTER LIVES\\n8speeche•good  2/27/00  11:08 AM  Page 8Within our borders, we must strengthen our immigration\\nsystem.\\nBeyond our borders, we have an obligation to help the poorest\\nof the world’s poor.\\nIn each of these areas we are providing additional funding.\\nThe New Economy\\nMr. Speaker, let me now turn from the responsibilities of the present\\nto the opportunities of the future. Let us address the new economy.\\nAt this, the beginning of the 21stcentury, we have a unique\\nchance to take hold of our destiny. The basic question we haveto answer is: What are the choices we must make today that in 5,10 and 20 years’ time will be seen as having made a criticaldifference in making Canada the land of opportunity?\\nPowered by the information revolution and a cascade of new\\ntechnologies, distance is disappearing, borders are collapsing anda world once divided is now connected as never before.\\nMicroprocessors and microchips, satellites, fibre optics and the\\nInternet are changing the way we live, work and communicate. Theresult is the most significant economic transformation of our time. \\nToday, the strength of a nation is measured not by the weapons\\nit wields, but by the patents it produces; not by the territory itcontrols, but by the ideas it advances; not only by the wealth ofits resources, but by the resourcefulness of its people.\\nIn such a world, successful nations will only be those that\\nfoster a culture of innovation. They will be those that create newknowledge and bring the product of that knowledge quickly tomarket. Our goal as a nation must be to lead the way.\\nOur goal must be to inspire a spirit of entrepreneurship, one\\nthat asks our people to reach higher and look further, one thatencourages us to see the world as our market, but Canada as theplace to live. \\nAs a country, we are well placed – far better than most – to seize\\nthe opportunities of the 21\\nstcentury. \\nBut there is nothing inevitable about our progress. SPEECH\\n9speeche•good  2/27/00  11:08 AM  Page 9If we are to capitalize on the opportunities of the new economy,\\nboth the private and public sectors have their roles to play.\\nThe private sector must change its concept of risk. It must\\nimprove access to capital, give greater priority to start-up companiesand exploit the full potential of new technologies like the Internet tocapture markets in every corner of the globe. \\nGovernment, in turn, must reduce the regulatory burden. It\\nmust help fill the gaps in an economy which is increasingly movingfrom brick to “click.”\\nWhat must government do?It must equip Canadians to succeed. That means:An education system second to none.Basic research – the raw material of the new economy.Secure social programs that recognize that real progress is\\nmade by reaching for the top, not racing to the bottom.\\nAnd a tax system that is both fair and competitive.\\nSkills and Knowledge  \\nMr. Speaker, if we are to talk about a more innovative economy,\\nwe must begin with people.\\nSkills and knowledge join the ambitions of the individual with\\nthe potential of the country. They are the meeting place betweensocial and economic policy – the best means available to us tonarrow the gap between rich and poor.  \\nThat is why, in 1998, we introduced the Canadian\\nOpportunities Strategy – a multi-part plan to expand access toknowledge and skills. \\nLast year, we built upon that foundation. And today, we\\nbuild further. \\nFirst of all, as we have already discussed, this budget increases\\nsupport to the provinces for post-secondary education by increasingthe cash available through the CHST. BETTER FINANCES, BETTER LIVES\\n10speeche•good  2/27/00  11:08 AM  Page 10Second, we will follow through on the commitment made in the\\nSpeech from the Throne to create new 21stcentury chairs for\\nresearch excellence.\\nThese will be new research positions at Canadian universities,\\ndesigned to attract the best researchers from around the world andto retain the best from across Canada. \\nHalf of these positions will be directed to Canada’s leading\\nscientists and half to the very best of the next generation of youngCanadian researchers.\\nIn October, the Prime Minister said, and I quote: “This\\ninvestment…will truly make Canada a leader in the knowledge-based economy, and will truly brand Canada as a country thatvalues excellence and is committed to success …”\\nThis initiative will help Canadian universities not only to meet\\nthe standards set by others today, but to set new standards thatothers will have to meet tomorrow.\\nTo this end, this budget provides $900 million of funding over\\nfive years for 2,000 new research chairs.\\nThird, as Canadians – especially young Canadians – turn more\\nand more to the Internet as a source of information, it is importantthat they see their own reflection and hear their own stories. \\nTherefore, in this budget, we are providing funding to enhance\\nthe presence of Canadian cultural material on the Internet in bothofficial languages. \\nFourth, scholarships and bursaries are an important part of\\nexpanding access to higher learning. In order to ensure that morestudents receive their full value, we are increasing the tax exemptionfrom its current level of $500 to $3,000.\\nSupporting Research\\nMr. Speaker, research and development is the foundation fornew products and processes. It is what smart companies always do.It is what smart countries must do.\\nQuite simply, we must ensure that within our borders we have a\\nresearch capacity that is constantly pushing forward the frontiers ofhuman knowledge.SPEECH\\n11speeche•good  2/27/00  11:08 AM  Page 11In the 1997 budget, this government created the Canada\\nFoundation for Innovation (CFI). To date, it has awarded$450 million to help post-secondary institutions, research hospitalsand not-for-profit organizations to modernize their laboratories,their equipment and their technologies.\\nAlmost half of its funding has been directed at health research. The CFI is one of the cornerstones of our plan to support the\\nnew economy but if we do not act now, its funding will run outwithin two years.\\nTherefore, in order to enable it to extend its awards into the\\nyear 2005, this budget provides $900 million to the CFI, raisingthe Government’s total investment to $1.9 billion.\\nMr Speaker, because health research holds such potential – to\\ncontribute not only to the quantity of our knowledge, but also tothe quality of our lives – last year’s budget announced the creationof the Canadian Institutes for Health Research – an initiative thatwill transform the way research is done in this country. \\nToday, we take another important step.Understanding how genes function opens the door to substantial\\nprogress in advancing the treatment of cancer and other life-threatening diseases.  \\nGene research will save the lives of many. It will enhance the\\nlives of still more. It will surely form the basis for many advances inbiotechnology, which many believe will be as important in the newcentury as computer technology was in the last.\\nFor this reason, we are announcing today that we will commit\\n$160 million to create the Genome Canada project – with fivecentres across the country, providing laboratory facilities forresearchers from universities, government and the private sector. \\nMr. Speaker, Canada is one of the world’s leaders in the field\\nof biotechnology. However, we recognize that biotechnology, forall its potential, also raises concerns. \\nCanadians want to know that we understand and can manage\\nits risks, that health, environmental and ethical limits will beidentified and respected. \\nTherefore, this budget will provide funding over the next\\nthree years to ensure that as we receive the benefits ofbiotechnology, we also have the ability to ensure its safety.BETTER FINANCES, BETTER LIVES\\n12speeche•good  2/27/00  11:08 AM  Page 12The Environment \\nMr. Speaker, for Canadians of all ages, protecting the environment\\nis not an option – it is something that we simply must do. It is afundamental value – beyond debate, beyond discussion. For thisreason, this budget provides additional resources to further clean upthe Great Lakes, ensure environmental enforcement, protect speciesat risk, aid international efforts to reduce organic pollutants in theNorth, and provides development assistance to deal with greenhousegas emissions in developing countries. \\nFurthermore, we are announcing today that in order to preserve\\nnatural habitats and species, we are cutting – by half – the capitalgains tax arising from the donation of ecologically sensitive lands.\\nMr. Speaker, in 1998 we, along with the other orders of\\ngovernment, non-governmental organizations and the private sector,launched the process required to develop a national climate changestrategy. These consultations are concluding and the strategy shouldbe unveiled by the end of the year.\\nHowever, within the context of a budget seeking to prepare\\nour economy for the 21\\nstcentury, there are a number of things we\\ncan and we must do now.\\nThe unequivocal fact is that climate change – indeed, the entire\\nenvironmental spectrum – will provide challenges, but for aninnovative economy it presents many more opportunities.\\nIndeed, those nations which demonstrate how to truly integrate\\nenvironmental and economic concerns will forge new tools anddevelop new technologies that others will have to adopt.\\nTremendous rewards await those nations that get there first,\\nfor those which do it best.\\nGiven the importance of natural resources to our country and\\nbecause of the severity of our climate, leadership in this area of thenew economy is not a matter of choice for Canada.\\nQuite simply, we must apply the same innovative thinking, the\\nsame spirit of enterprise, the same technological ingenuity, toprotecting and enhancing our environment, as we have to becomingworld leaders in the fields of telecommunications, transportationand so many others. \\nTechnology is key. SPEECH\\n13speeche•good  2/27/00  11:08 AM  Page 13Make no mistake, if we are to successfully tackle climate\\nchange, if we are to cut costs and boost productivity, if we areto transform ourselves into the world leader in the field of cleanenergy, then we have to employ every bit of the skill and knowledgewe possess.\\nAccordingly, this budget takes a number of targeted actions.First, we are announcing today the creation of the Sustainable\\nDevelopment Technology Fund. This fund will foster innovationby helping companies develop new technologies and bring themto market in areas such as clean burning coal and new fuelcell developments.\\nSecond, we are announcing that we will create the Canadian\\nFoundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences – a network ofinstitutes which will link researchers from across the country inorder, for instance, to further our understanding of the impact ofclimate change and air pollution on human health.\\nThird, this government is beginning to change its procurement\\npolicy to move, as much as possible, to more environmentallyfriendly energy, stimulating market demand for green power. \\nFourth, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities and\\nLa Coalition pour le renouvellement des infrastructures duQuébec have worked on excellent proposals in the area of greeninfrastructure. These allow us to extend the hand of partnership tothose on the front lines of the fight for a cleaner environment.\\nOne of these proposals is a Green Municipal Enabling Fund\\nto help communities assess where their environmental needsare greatest. \\nA second is a revolving fund, leveraging private sector\\ninvestment in areas such as waste management and waterconservation at the municipal level.\\nThis budget, Mr. Speaker, gives effect to both proposals.Finally, as we move to more fully integrate economic and\\nenvironmental policy, we must come to grips with the fact thatthe current means of measuring progress are inadequate. \\nTherefore, we are announcing today that the National Round\\nTable on the Environment and the Economy and EnvironmentCanada, in collaboration with Statistics Canada, will be providedBETTER FINANCES, BETTER LIVES\\n14speeche•good  2/27/00  11:08 AM  Page 14funding over the next three years to develop a set of indicators to\\nmeasure environmental performance in conjunction with economicperformance. \\nIn the years ahead, these environmental indicators could well\\nhave a greater impact on public policy than any other singlemeasure we might introduce.\\nMr. Speaker, when all of these measures are taken together, this\\nbudget will invest $700 million in environmental technologies andpractices. We are making this investment because protection of theenvironment is a fundamental value of our country. But let usunderstand as well, it is also good economic policy. It is a keyelement of our plan to build a more innovative economy.\\nMake no mistake, far from being a cost we cannot afford,\\nenvironmental protection is an opportunity we cannot forego.\\nMr. Speaker, there is another aspect of our plan that is of critical\\nimportance. To succeed in the new economy, we must ensure that ittakes root in every part of our country. \\nThis perspective was at the heart of Catching Tomorrow’s Wave ,\\na report prepared by our Atlantic caucus. We have heard them loudand clear.\\nIndeed, a similar point has been made by other members of our\\ncaucus – in a very different context.\\nThey point out that while we must ensure that all provinces\\nparticipate in the benefits of the new economy, even withinprovinces, there are major differences between urban and ruralcommunities.\\nThe concerns of rural Canadians are those shared by all\\nCanadians – quality health care, the best education for theirchildren, a good job. The difference is that, in the case of ruralCanada, a hospital closing, a school cutback or the loss of a majoremployer threatens the very life of the community.\\nTherefore, we must expand economic development in smaller\\ncommunities right across the country, north and south, east andwest. We must recognize that in the years ahead, all orders ofgovernment have to come together, as never before, to broadenopportunities right across the country.SPEECH\\n15speeche•good  2/27/00  11:08 AM  Page 15As one example, that is why we said last week that, in addition\\nto monies previously announced to meet farm needs across Canada,we would commit a further $240 million for farm families on theprairies. When combined with an additional $160 million from theconcerned provinces, this provides an immediate relief package of$400 million.\\nMr. Speaker, we can also enhance opportunities across Canada\\nby strengthening the basic physical infrastructure which underpinsso much of the economic activity of both rural and urban Canada. \\nWhether it is urban transit, a grain road on the prairies or\\nthe highways of our country, the capacity to move people andgoods safely and efficiently is key to an innovative and productiveeconomy. \\nAffordable housing and green infrastructure are also essential\\nelements of a modern society. They are critical to meeting the21\\nstcentury needs of our municipalities.\\nTo these ends, the Government has announced that we will\\nwork with other orders of government and, where applicable, theprivate sector to reach agreement on a plan to improve provincialand municipal infrastructure in cities and rural communitiesacross Canada.\\nWe hope to have an agreement by the end of the year. For its\\npart, the federal government is prepared to commit $450 millionover the next two years and $550 million in each of the followingfour years.\\nChildren\\nMr. Speaker, having spoken about what it will take to succeed in theworld of tomorrow, let me turn now to the authors of that future –our children.\\nLet there be no doubt: assisting families is not only the smart\\nthing to do, it is the right thing to do.\\nAn important key to our children’s success is the strength of the\\ncommunities in which they live.\\nThat is why federal and provincial governments agreed to\\ndevelop a National Children’s Agenda – to expand the capacityof governments, voluntary organizations and our communities toprovide the services and support upon which so many of ourfamilies and their children rely.BETTER FINANCES, BETTER LIVES\\n16speeche•good  2/27/00  11:08 AM  Page 16This agenda is critical. And it simply must be advanced.\\nAs the next step, the Prime Minister invited all governments\\nto reach agreement, by December of this year, on an action planfor early childhood development.\\nOur objective is simple. Whether it be further services or\\nincome supports, all orders of government must be prepared todo more for our children.\\nIn this same respect, in the Speech from the Throne, the\\nGovernment committed itself to improving support for children byextending maternity and parental benefits under the employmentinsurance program from the current six months to one year. Thisbudget honours that commitment.\\nMr. Speaker, these initiatives focus on the needs of children.\\nThey deal with the services and programs their families require.\\nBut let there be no doubt, one of the best things we can do is\\nto leave parents with more money at the end of each month toinvest in their children’s well-being. \\nTax Relief\\nIt was with this very much in mind that the Government sought todesign its tax reduction plan. \\nThe principles underlying that package are as follows:First, while tax reduction must ultimately benefit all Canadians\\nit must primarily benefit those who need it the most – middle- andlow-income earners, especially families with children.\\nSecond, broad-based tax reductions should focus initially on\\npersonal income taxes.\\nThird, the business tax system must be internationally\\ncompetitive.\\nAnd finally, broad-based tax reductions should not be financed\\nwith borrowed money. \\nIn the 1997, 1998 and 1999 budgets we lowered the average\\npersonal tax burden of Canadians by 10 per cent.SPEECH\\n17speeche•good  2/27/00  11:08 AM  Page 17Today, with surpluses projected for the coming years, the time\\nhas come to do more. Today we are setting out a five-year tax planso that individuals, families, small businesses and others will knowfor certain that their taxes will fall this year, next year and in theyears to come.\\nThe plan we are presenting today provides real and significant\\ntax relief. It is anchored in two fundamental structural changes.\\nFirst, Canadians know that taxes cannot start to come down in\\nearnest until they stop going up with inflation.\\nInflation should not force lower-income Canadians onto the\\ntax rolls and others into higher tax brackets. \\nNor should inflation erode the real value of the Canada Child\\nTax Benefit and the goods and services tax (GST) credit. \\nNor should it erode the real value of the age credit for Canadian\\nseniors, nor the income level at which the Old Age Security beginsto be reduced.\\nTherefore, we will make the most important change to the\\nCanadian tax system in more than a decade.\\nWe will restore full indexation to the personal income tax\\nsystem – and we will do so immediately. \\nIndeed, we will do so retroactively – to January 1, 2000.Second, it has been over 12 years since the actual tax rates of\\nCanadians have come down.\\nIn practical terms, this has hit middle-income earners the\\nhardest, because the federal tax rate jumps by 9 points – from 17 to26 per cent – as soon as someone’s income reaches $30,000. \\nTherefore, over the next five years, we will lower the middle tax\\nrate from 26 to 23 per cent. \\nMost importantly, we are announcing today that two-thirds of\\nthat reduction – down to 24 per cent – will go into effect on July 1of this year.\\nMr. Speaker, re-indexing the tax system and lowering tax rates\\nwill provide a significant benefit for all Canadians but as well, wewill go further. BETTER FINANCES, BETTER LIVES\\n18speeche•good  2/27/00  11:08 AM  Page 18Over the next five years, we will increase the amounts\\nCanadians can receive tax-free to at least $8,000 and we will raisethe income levels at which middle and upper tax rates begin toapply to at least $35,000 and $70,000 respectively. \\nThese amounts will provide significant relief but they are only\\nthe start. In future budgets, when we can do more, we will.\\nMr. Speaker these structural changes mean substantial tax relief\\nfor all Canadians.\\nBut for families, we are doing more. I hardly need to remind this House that the cost of raising\\nchildren is a significant expense. Ask any parent about the price ofnew shoes, or snowsuits. Ask any parent whose child plays sportsor takes music lessons. Ask any parent trying to save for theirchild’s education.\\nThe purpose of the Canada Child Tax Benefit – the CCTB – is to\\nhelp with these costs. \\nIn July 2000, the maximum payment for a family’s first child\\nwill rise to $1,975, a level at which it was to remain in 2001 andsubsequent years. \\nInstead of leaving the benefit at that level, we are announcing\\ntoday that the CCTB will be further increased in July 2001 to$2,265, and to $2,400 over the next five years. Amounts for eachadditional child will keep pace with these increases.\\nNine out of ten Canadian children will benefit from these\\nimprovements. \\nMr. Speaker, at the present time, the Canada Child Tax Benefit is\\nof greatest value to lower-income Canadians. The measures we areintroducing today will add to that benefit while extending it morefully for middle-income families.\\nFor example, a single mother earning $25,000, with one child,\\nwill see her benefits increase by 22 per cent by 2004.\\nA typical family with two children, earning $60,000, will receive\\n$200 in additional benefits in 2001. By the fifth year, their benefitwill more than double – from $733 to $1,541.SPEECH\\n19speeche•good  2/27/00  11:08 AM  Page 19Mr. Speaker, the challenges of raising a family are compounded\\nwhen a child has a disability. In some of these cases, full-time homecare by a parent is a necessity. We will assist these families byincreasing the disability tax credit by up to $500 per year.\\nIn addition, for families with disabled children, we will increase\\nthe maximum annual child care expense deduction from $7,000 to$10,000.\\nWe will also introduce a number of other tax measures to\\nfurther assist persons with disabilities and we will make permanentthe Opportunities Fund – a pilot project to assist persons withdisabilities prepare for, obtain and keep employment.\\nMr. Speaker, our government inherited three major legacies in\\nthe area of income tax which had been introduced to help reducethe deficit.\\nIn 1999, we eliminated the 3-per-cent surtax.This budget restores indexation of the personal income\\ntax system.\\nToday, we are also committing to eliminate the last of\\nthese legacies.\\nEffective this July, we will eliminate the surtax for middle-\\nincome Canadians on earnings up to $85,000. Over the nextfive years, we will eliminate it altogether.\\nMr. Speaker, since 1994, employment insurance (EI) rates have\\nbeen reduced each and every year – from $3.07 to $2.40. Theserates will keep coming down to the point where they cover just thecosts of the EI program itself. For planning purposes, we haveassumed that they will fall to $2.00 in 2004.\\nMr. Speaker, adequate incomes in retirement are a critical\\nrequirement for any society. Diversification of registered retirementsavings plans and registered pension plans, in turn, is an importantpart of ensuring that income.\\nAccordingly, we will increase the foreign content allowed in\\nretirement plans to 30 per cent, beginning with a 5-percentage-pointrise in the year 2000, followed by another 5-point rise in 2001.\\nMr. Speaker, to sustain the growth which underpins our\\neconomy, we need a corporate tax system that is internationallycompetitive.BETTER FINANCES, BETTER LIVES\\n20speeche•good  2/27/00  11:08 AM  Page 20At the moment, a number of Canadian industries do enjoy\\ncompetitive tax rates of about 21 per cent. \\nBut there are others – where much of the new job creation is\\noccurring, such as high-tech services – which shoulder tax rates thatare much higher, yet they are up against companies around theworld that pay lower taxes in their home countries.\\nIf we are to unleash the creative energies of our economy, if we\\nare to encourage innovation and expand job creation, then these taxrates must be brought down to allow our companies to competevigorously.\\nTherefore, Mr. Speaker, we are announcing that over the\\nnext five years, we will lower the tax rate for these higher-taxedindustries from 28 to 21 per cent – putting all sectors of theCanadian economy on an internationally competitive footing. \\nAs a first step, the rate will drop to 27 per cent as of\\nJanuary 1, 2001.\\nMr. Speaker we have talked about the importance of innovation\\nin developing a modern economy. And just as we are makinginvestments to that end, we must also introduce tax measures thatencourage entrepreneurship and risk taking. \\nThis budget proposes action on three fronts. First, we will reduce the taxation of capital gains by lowering\\ntheir inclusion rate from three-quarters to two-thirds, effectiveimmediately.\\nSecond, we will allow up to $100,000 in stock options granted\\nannually to be exercised with the tax being paid only when theshares are actually sold.\\nThird, a key factor contributing to the difficulty of raising\\ncapital by new start-ups is the fact that individuals who sell existinginvestments and reinvest in others must pay tax on any realizedcapital gains. \\nTherefore, Mr. Speaker, we will allow a $500,000 tax-free\\nrollover for qualifying investments, thereby increasing the amountthese investors can put into new ventures. \\nFinally, Mr. Speaker, this budget proposes a measure which\\nspecifically benefits small but growing businesses – a major engineof both innovation and job growth in our economy.SPEECH\\n21speeche•good  2/27/00  11:08 AM  Page 21Small businesses have told us that the most important steps we\\ncould take to assist them would be to lower personal income taxes,provide for rollovers, remove the 5-per-cent surtax and reduce thetax on capital gains.\\nThis budget does all of these. It also, however, includes one\\nfurther measure.\\nAt the present time, the corporate tax rate rises dramatically –\\nfrom 12 to 28 per cent – once non-manufacturing small businessesreach $200,000 in income. \\nWe are announcing today that the reduction in the corporate\\nrate to 21 per cent, which is being phased in for large businesses,will fully apply to all small business on income between $200,000and $300,000, effective January 1, 2001.\\nMr. Speaker, the five-year tax plan – both personal and\\ncorporate – which we have outlined today is far-reaching, both interms of the structural direction it outlines and in terms of the sizeof the tax relief it permits.\\nMr. Speaker, this budget provides a minimum of $58 billion in\\ncumulative tax relief to Canadians over the next five years, it cutspersonal income taxes by an average of 15 per cent and for many,much more than that.\\nFor low- and middle-income Canadians, for instance, taxes will\\nfall by some 18 per cent on average, and for families with children,by an average of 21 per cent.\\nLet me give you some specific examples of how this budget will\\nbenefit Canadians.\\nIndexation will help lower-income Canadians most. Indeed,\\nthey will receive almost 40 per cent of the tax reduction it affords.\\nThey will receive more than $500 million by the fifth year in\\nadditional GST credits. They will automatically receive increasesin child tax benefits.\\nOther examples:Two seniors, with family income of $30,000, will see their net\\nfederal taxes fall by 45 per cent by 2004.\\nA one-earner family of four earning $40,000 will see its net\\nfederal taxes reduced by 17 per cent next year and by 48 per centby 2004. That is a savings of more than $1,600. BETTER FINANCES, BETTER LIVES\\n22speeche•good  2/27/00  11:08 AM  Page 22A one-earner family of four with income up to $32,000\\nwill receive more in benefits than they will pay in federal taxes.As a result, they will pay no net federal tax next year and by 2004,this family will be able to earn up to $35,000 and still pay no netfederal tax.\\nA single parent earning $30,000, with one child, will see his or\\nher net federal benefits increase from $32 to $1,018 by 2004.\\nA two-earner family with two children, with an income of\\n$40,000, will see their net taxes cut almost in half next year, andthey will pay no net federal tax by 2004. This represents a savingsof $1,244.\\nFinally, a two-earner family with two children and with $60,000\\nin income will see their taxes cut by almost 9 per cent next year andby 27 per cent by 2004. That is a saving of more than $1,500.\\nOne further point – at the beginning of this presentation, I said\\nthat while we would set out five-year objectives we would make ourdecisions based on a rolling two-year time horizon. \\nThis is particularly important when hearing these examples\\nbecause it means that substantial as they are, the tax cuts outlined inthis budget reflect the least, not the most, we will do. In subsequentbudgets, as resources permit, we will do more. \\nThat is how we eliminated the deficit. That is how we will\\nreduce taxes.\\nConclusion\\nMr. Speaker, this is a budget with many elements, but a singletheme: creating better lives for Canadians in a rapidlychanging world.\\nIt is a budget that makes innovation the driving force of\\nour economy.\\nIt puts more money into post-secondary education and\\nhealth care.\\nIt acts to preserve our environment and to capture the\\nopportunities it affords.\\nIt speaks to our values by recognizing the importance of\\nchildren.SPEECH\\n23speeche•good  2/27/00  11:08 AM  Page 23Mr. Speaker, this budget restores indexation to the Canadian\\ntax system. \\nIt cuts federal tax rates for the first time in more than 12 years.It supports job growth by making Canadian business more\\ninternationally competitive.\\nIt is a budget that says you can cut taxes and invest in tomorrow\\nat the same time.\\nIt is a budget that sets its sights firmly on the future and charts\\nthe course to take us there.\\nIt is a budget that says, while we can’t imagine the world our\\nchildren will live to see, our responsibility to their future is clear. \\nWe must lay the foundation on which they will stand; we must\\npreserve the values on which they will build. \\nMay it be said of us that we, in our time, laid that foundation\\nand preserved those values. \\nAnd may we embrace the future with confidence – the\\nconfidence of a people who know that for all of our achievementsas a nation, for all of the greatness of our history, the best ofCanada is yet to come.BETTER FINANCES, BETTER LIVES\\n24speeche•good  2/27/00  11:08 AM  Page 24'"
